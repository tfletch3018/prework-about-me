      <p>I believe that web development is the wave of the future. I think 2020 showed us all that the world is changing. There has been a huge increase in the demand for online/ contact-less services. As a result, the industry professionals that create and service these online platforms are also in extremely high demand. This is an excellent time for me to learn a new skillset that will enable me to smoothly transition into this growing industry.    </p>
